# InteractiveUMAP
Interactive UMAP plotter. Good for data visualization. 

Currently there is no Data, which will be published following our publication. You can just point the file opener function to the filepath where your data is stored, and it will return an interactive plot with hover information, and clickable points that produce a spectrogram and played audio. Input is MatFile objects.
